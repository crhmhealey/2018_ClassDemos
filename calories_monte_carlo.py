'''
This Monte Carlo simulator makes a guess at how many calories you will consume in cookies at holiday parties. It assumes that you will attend somewhere from 1-10 parties, and that you will eat 2-8 cookies, and that each cookie will contain anywhere from 40-200 calories. It then charts the possible outcomes using matplotlib.
